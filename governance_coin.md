## Features of the Governance Coin

The Xar layer 1 DeFi protocol was designed with custom configuration in mind and allows for a secondary, governance token to be leveraged for most system functionalities.

While to facilitate stable staking, the stable (or index) coin has to be used by validators, this is the only area where this coin is an absolute requirement. The following is a list of all areas that are configurable, and not entirely dependent on the usage of the stable coin.

If however, stable staking is not required, and instead an inflationary coin is used, then this can also be interchanged with the governance coin

### Stable Staking Governance Coin Use Cases

* Primary collateral source (gov coin can be set with the highest debt limit and the lowest collateral ratio)
* Transaction fees (default 0.0025gov)
* Borrowing interest can be repaid in the governance coin (accrued in native asset, repaid by gov coin)
* DEX market pairs (all pairs quoted in pair/gov, default fees 0.3%)
* Coinswap liquidity pairs (all pairs denominated in gov, default fees 0.3%)
* Governance proposals (fixed value, example 100gov)
* Synthetic denominated value (all trades denominated in gov token, buy with gov token, sell to gov token, fees in gov token ~0.3% - 3%)

### Inflationary Staking Governance Coin Use Cases

* Primary collateral source (gov coin can be set with the highest debt limit and the lowest collateral ratio)
* Minimum staking requirement (example 1,000,000gov)
* Transaction fees (default 0.0025gov)
* Borrowing interest can be repaid in the governance coin (accrued in native asset, repaid by gov coin)
* DEX market pairs (all pairs quoted in pair/gov, default fees 0.3%)
* Coinswap liquidity pairs (all pairs denominated in gov, default fees 0.3%)
* Governance proposals (fixed value, example 100gov)
* Synthetic denominated value (all trades denominated in gov token, buy with gov token, sell to gov token, fees in gov token ~0.3% - 3%)
* Slashing (0.0001% for downtime, 5% for double signing)
